# Recipes

A simple self-hosted recipe app built with Go and server-side rendered HTML. Store, browse, and create recipes through a clean web interface.

## Features

- Browse all recipes with filtering by type and cook time
- View recipe details with ingredients and step-by-step instructions
- Create new recipes through a web form (password protected)
- JSON file storage — no database needed
- Norwegian UI

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/) (for local development)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for containerized setup)

### Password

Recipe creation is protected by a password. The app expects a SHA-256 hash of the password in the environment.

Generate a password hash:

```sh
./hashpass.sh
```

### Environment variables

| Variable        | Description                        | Example         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `PORT`          | Port to listen on                  | `:8080`         |
| `PASSWORD_HASH` | SHA-256 hash of the admin password | `5e884898da...` |

## Run locally

1. Set `PASSWORD_HASH` in `.env` using the output from `./hashpass.sh`.

2. Run the server:

```sh
go run ./cmd
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Run with Docker Compose

```sh
# Get password hash and change it in docker-compose.yaml
./hashpass.sh

# Build and run the container
docker compose up --build -d
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Recipe data is stored in a Docker volume (`recipe-data`) and persists across container restarts.
